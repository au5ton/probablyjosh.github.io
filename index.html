					<p> I'm a 16 year old software engineer from Vancouver, Canada,
							with a passion for creation. I'm currently working on <a href="https://github.com/madebybright/Nimble">Nimble</a>,
							a cross-platform Wolfram-AlphaÂ® menubar client, with <a href="http://madebybright.com">Bright</a>, a little startup I co-founded.

					<p>Since the age of 2 I've had a passion for creation, primarily on computers. I started using computers as a
						toddler and ever since then my passion has only increased. I found programming at 11, and it instantly intruiged me as a tool
						I could use to create something of my own, with nearly infinite possibilities and flexibility. And I've been learning since then.
						Most of the code I've written in the last few years is available on <a href="https://github.com/trmml">GitHub</a>,
						including <a href="https://github.com/trmml/trmml.github.io">this website</a>.</p>

					<p>Outside of computers, I also love working with film, however that may be. Above all, directing, <a href="http://joshtrommel.com/script">screenwriting</a>, and editing. I've held this passion for over 7 years,
						finding it in my high school's video production summer camp in 2009. I attended every year following, and I've been creating films ever since. Although I currently do not have an outlet where I publish my work in film,
						I'm considering creating a Vimeo account in the near future and exporting my work there. Not only do I love to create films, I love to watch them as well. I keep track of the movies
						and TV shows I watch over at <a href="https://trakt.tv/users/probablyjosh">Trakt.tv</a>.</p>

					<p>Photography is also something I've been very fond of for a little over 5 years. Unlike film, I publish my photos online, which you can find on my <a href="https://instagram.com/joshtrommel">Instagram</a>.
					I enjoy photography because the ability to capture and preseve a memory forever is something special, and
					being able to see the beauty in every day life is also something I want to challenge myself to do. It's also a great
					creative outlet, so when I'm not programming I like to take photos with either my Canon EOS REBEL T3i or my iPhone 6.</p>

					<p>Music has also been a huge part of my life, and I'm sure I'm not alone with that. I enjoy keeping track of the music I listen to, as I find analytically overviewing my music genre habits is a good way at
						keeping track of many factors of my life, primarily my mood. <span id="artists"></span> I keep track of the music I listen to on <a href="https://last.fm/user/jshtrmml">Last.fm</a>. I'm also starting to write and record some of my own music,
						which I've been uploading to SoundCloud. More on that soon.</p>

					<p>I also love to write, and I've had this passion for as long as I can remember. As I could never find anything interesting to write about as a child, I decided to buy a journal to write about my day when I was 6 years old.
						My grandfather gave me one of his Uni-Ball pens and I was set. I filled up 3 full journals. Recently my writing has taken to online, primarily <a href="https://nulljosh.svbtle.com">my blog</a>.</p>
