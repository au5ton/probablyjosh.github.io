Things are going well, so that’s good. Life is more spontaneous than last time I wrote a post, and I think that was my major goal since like forever, so that’s currently being achieved, I think.

Life is turning up, I think. I’m never really sure, but I think I’m happier now than I was a few months ago. I can’t really pinpoint it to a certain one thing, but I feel a bit happier than I was before. Maybe it’s just the lessening of the constant repetition, day in, day out, maybe it’s something more. I’m just glad I feel happy, since that’s sort of what life’s purpose it. I’ve started listening to
[Counting Crows](http://open.spotify.com/track/2Uwjr7EnHRXMgmL9SmX1Gj)
 nonstop. Can’t get enough of their music, Adam Duritz and the awesome piano in most songs and Adam Duritz, just listening to their songs kind of makes me feel a bit more lively, I don’t really know how to explain it. Listen to [Omaha](http://open.spotify.com/track/2Uwjr7EnHRXMgmL9SmX1Gj),
 you’ll know what I mean.
