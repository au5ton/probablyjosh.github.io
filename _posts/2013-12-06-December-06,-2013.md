**Before you read this,** I suggest reading [my entire feud about how Monday went down](http://joshuatrommel.com/december-2-2013). It's kind of important.

**Anyways, today is my second day back at school after my suspension.** It's been alright, and I haven't been called back into the office about any of the problems that I caused, which I'm happy about. I'm just glad it's over, and I'm going to be a lot more careful about what I post on the internet, because you never know who's reading it (or why, for that matter).

**I've been switched out of Info Tech,** which I think is for the best. According to [my principle] I'm in foods / cooking now. I've been pretty excited about this since I was alerted of it, but today I found out I'm *not* in foods by the foods teacher herself. I went to ask [my principle] what had happened and if something had changed, but he was in a meeting, so now I'm in the library, printing off homework and writing this.

**Now that you're up to date-** It's been a long week. I don't actually have a lot to talk about because other than the suspension nothing has happened recently that's really had an impact on me. Maybe something should have, but maybe I've been too tired to realize. *I guess my new goal is to get more sleep.*

**I'm going to print off some homework and probably head home now,** so I guess I'll post this and hope people like it.

***Bye <3***
