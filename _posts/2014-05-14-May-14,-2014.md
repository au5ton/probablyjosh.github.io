**Hey.** The only reason I'm doing a blog post today is because [Sophia](https://twitter.com/Sophia_Anne99) said she likes my blog posts. If it weren't for her, I'd probably be sleeping (or probably on [Imgur](http://imgur.com/)).

**Alright**, so [last blog post](http://blog.imjosh.me/april-30-2014) basically reviewed the holiday *way* back in March, so that's pretty crazy. I'm getting caught up in the past, because, after all, the past is a cool place. Well, that's depending how far you go back. Like, I wouldn't want to be alive for the Black Plague or The Holocaust or anything.

I just realized my blog is now going to be indexed by the word "holocaust". *Fantastic.*

**Anyways,** I'm listening to [Further On Down the Road](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_e49phsuRQ) (the live version of the song is all I could find. Sorry), and coding a web crawler for [LastHack](https://github.com/LastHack/lasthack-crawler), a project I haven't gone over in a blog post yet. I'm not sure if anyone who reads this post will find any interest in LastHack, so I'll keep the description simple. *It's a script that runs in the background, finding [open-sourced](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) projects, which you can use to improve your own code in various ways.* If any of you have any use for that, go check it out. It's a cool idea ([Cameron](https://twitter.com/thetoxicarcade) thought of it- I'm just helping him out).

**Today was a pretty good day.** I woke up and ate Nutella toast because that's literally the best food in the world. I don't care if it's a "white girl stereotype". Obviously white girls have a good taste in food. I went to school because that's what kids do.

**My first class was Video Production** and it was fairly exciting. It could've been better, it could've been worse. We were assigned our last project of the year. It's a pretty flexible project because we get to choose our own groups and the genre of the film, which is nice. I chose to work with Sami and Justin, and Alexis was put in our group because she didn't end up choosing anyone. In the end, it's a good group and I can work with them to make a (hopefully) good movie.

**I had Band next,** which was also pretty fun. We played music.

**I had double block of English,** which is normally not a great thing, but in the end we had absolutely no work assigned. We watched an hour long movie about advertisement.

**At Lunch,** I went with Sami to the courtyard and showed him and his group of friends a comedy Sami and I had been part of / made for Video Production.

**For the second block of English,** we discussed our thoughts and opinions on the advertisement movie for an hour. *Damn, son. Exciting.*

**Last block was Gym,** and we played Hockey. Half the class took everything too intensely and tried to injure everyone for the puck, and the other half took it as it is; Grade 9 gym class hockey.

**Today was Tutorial Wednesday,** so school dismissal was an hour early. I showed some more people the video (the one I mentioned at Lunch) in the Video room. Then I walked with Sophia, Adam, Jamie and Ford to Camy's, where Sophia met Parim, the awesome Pizza Guy. I said bye to Sophia and Ford, and sprinted up to where Adam and Jamie were headed; Ed's Market. When I caught up to Jamie and Adam, Jamie told us some jokes regarding [Mr. Turi playing in his band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCvMB51i7JM). Adam bought me a Screamer (a slushee with soft serve ice cream- it's absolutely delicious), and then we walked home.

**When I got home,** I spent about half an hour watching YouTube videos, and another hour learning Ruby on [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com).

Now I'm listening to [Further On Down the Road](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_e49phsuRQ) (the live version of the song is all I could find. Sorry), and coding a web crawler for [LastHack](https://github.com/LastHack/lasthack-crawler), a project I haven't gone over in a blog post yet.
