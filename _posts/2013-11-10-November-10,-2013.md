**Hi again**.

First off, I've been making a couple changes with domains, and want to get that cleared off. I know this probably isn't 'blog' material, but whatever. [imjosh.me](http://imjosh.me) is my main website. I don't really have much there, other than a couple links to different social networks. I'm planning to do something with it *eventually*. My other domain is [joshuatrommel.com](http://joshuatrommel.com) which, as you can see if you click the link, is being used for my svbtle blog. I've moved from WordPress because I was finally invited *(after months of waiting)* to [svbtle.com](http://svbtle.com), so I moved everything from WordPress over here, and I'm glad everything went smoothly because I don't want to go back to WordPress any time soon.
*Good, now that's off my chest and hopefully everyone knows where to go.*

**Today was a great day. Productive in a certain aspect, non-productive whatsoever in another.** Today, I sat at home for almost 12 hours screwing around with my Wii. I also Skyped with Lakota and his friend for a couple hours, and talked to Mercedez all day. I didn't even make myself food, I just had cereal twice, and leftover chicken from Montana's last night. While I was doing this, everyone else went to America, land of the free *(haha not really)*. Pretty antisocial, I guess, but in retrospect it makes sense (kinda), because everyone is so loud. I don't care for loud people, unless there's a certain reason they have to be loud. Anyways, I'm getting a little off topic, which I tend to do quite often. **Ahem.**

After 10 years of craving [Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_The_Wind_Waker) I finally got it working.. kinda. I [softmodded](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmod#Softmods_for_Nintendo_Wii) my Wii, and then installed a couple files that allow it to run files from a USB. I then found the [.ISO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_image) file for it on some random website, burned it to the USB, and finally got everything working perfectly. The entire *'project'* took about 4 hours. I then played Wind Waker for **at least 10 hours** *(I lost track of time).* Total time waster, but I'm glad I did it, because it was **awesome**. My next *'project'* is to get the [Ocarina of Time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Ocarina_of_Time) game working, because it's apparently awesome, according to [this tweet](https://twitter.com/HiddenPaws/status/399758811658850304).

*Other than that, I didn't really do anything today. But I think everyone needs days like that once in a while.*

***A quiet peaceful day to play Zelda.***
