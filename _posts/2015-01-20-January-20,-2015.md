Well, it's been a while. I keep putting off writing this because of the classic "I have nothing to write about", and the same thing still remains true. I'll write this as another "check-up" because I don't have much to discuss, but I have something to throw into the pot (a small "contribution" to myself?), and that is that I might start to use [this blog](http://104.131.26.135/) instead, which is using [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), a really nice blogging platform. I can also host everything on my own server (open-sourced things are nice) so things are on my own terms now. At the moment I don't have anything on there but I might just move all of my posts from here to there in the future. I don't know.

Things are going well, not much to add. Not working on anything at the moment but I'm learning Swift, Apple's new language for iOS and OS X development. It's interesting and fun to be excited about something tech related since that hasn't happened for a while. Swift is interesting and it has nice syntax (sometimes) so that's cool.

Anyways, like I said, I don't have a ton to add, so I'll just leave it at that.
