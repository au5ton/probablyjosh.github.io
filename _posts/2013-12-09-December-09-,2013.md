**There's 4 days until report cards.** Damn. Damn damn. Not good, not good.

**Everything has gone alright with everything in life,** I guess. Nothing extremely disastrous has happened to me so I take that as an achievement.

**On another note,** I've changed almost everything I own to [burgundy](http://www.colorhexa.com/900020), red, or something close. All the links on [my website](http://imjosh.me) are red now, and I went out and bought a burgundy beanie (toque?) and a burgundy (along with other colours) sweater. It's a sudden change from [this particular shade of blue](http://www.colorhexa.com/3498db), but I think I like it. Apologies about going on a small rant about burgundy and my change to it.

**Like most people, I'm looking forward to the holidays.** It's a nice break from school and time to spend time with family and friends while not having to put on pants, which is the ultimate win because pants are terrible *(pyjamas4lyfe)*.

**I really haven't had anything too interesting happen to me lately,** despite the suspension happen so recently. Even though that seemed to cause a bump in the road everything is back to normal, *mostly*. I've made a few changes, mostly to making a [private twitter](http://twitter.com/joshtrommel) for personal friends so that I don't have to be so careful and superstitious about what I say. This doesn't mean that I'm going to go start writing garbage on it, it's just a place I can write without being suspended over my (possibly awful) opinions. Hopefully I'm not suspended for writing that as well. As nice as I try to be I want to get one point across that's been on my mind for a while - If you don't like something on the internet, leave it alone unless it's viciously negatively directly affecting you. That's all I have to say, I hope forever.

**Although not a lot has happened to me recently,** I was able to start a [Medium account](http://medium.com/@nulljosh), where I've only posted [this story](https://medium.com/p/e016c3cd42ff) about the internet.

**Reading over this post,** it looks like I jumped around to different topics a ton. I need to make a "do's and don'ts" for writing sometime. I guess that's all I can think of writing about. ***Ciao.***
