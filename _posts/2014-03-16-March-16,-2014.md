**I'm trying to think of how many things have happened since I last wrote a post.**

**Lately I've been learning JavaScript, which is fun (and painful).** Using CoffeeScript has a pre-compiler makes it a lot easier though, as well as a lot more fun. I'm writing [pass.js](http://github.com/trommel/pass.js), which is a password parser- which is essentially pointless, right now, anyways. With JavaScript / CoffeeScript, I've been coding a couple scripts based on things that are completely irrelevant to modern programming. They're pointless, but they're fun to make. I made a calculator based off my math teacher, Mr. Koo, appropriately titled "[Calkoolator](http://github.com/trommel/calkoolator)". I also made an even stupider script called [YogaStar](http://github.com/istx25/yogastar), which "tracks how many girls with yoga pants you've seen today". YogaStar might not still be on GitHub by the time you're reading this because I gave the repo to my friend, Douglas, and he might have deleted the repo.

**It's also Pi Day, so that's cool.** *3.14159265359.*

**I can't think of a lot to write about today, but I'm going on holidays tomorrow,**  which also means Spring Break, so I'm psyched. I'll update more then.
