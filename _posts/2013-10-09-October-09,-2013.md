**Alright,** so this is my first post. According to obvious standards I should be addressing what I'm doing here, what I'm going to be talking about, etc, etc. The answer to that question is a bit hard to give, because I don't know what I'm going to be talking about. Hopefully anybody that reads this will find whatever it is interesting, but I won't have a specific topic. Hopefully that clears everything up about the subject.

**To those who don't know, hi, I'm Josh.** If you want to get to know me a bit more, [follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/nulljosh). Also, you can [visit my website](http://imjosh.me) which, by the way, is more of an index of links than a website.

**Thanks for taking a look at my ‘blog’.** Hopefully later on I'll have more interesting topics to write about..
