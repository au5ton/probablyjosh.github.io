Good lord, it’s been a while. I’m sorry to the probable 5-or-so people who read this blog, if this is even a valid reason to apologize.

Anyways, let’s try to brief up on the things that’ve happened recently since I haven’t updated anything for, like, 3 months.

In March we had Spring Break and Better Call Saul. On the last day of Spring Break (I think) Jadon and I watched 6 hours of Better Call Saul to catch up on the episodes we’d missed. That’s the thing that stands out the most in March, for whatever reason.

Easter was in April but other things happened, too. Apple announced their WWDC Student Scholarship rules and everyone got cracking on their résumé-like apps. Last Friday at around noon the winners received emails letting them know they won the golden ticket. I was one of the unlucky ones, but I’ll try again next year with more knowledge and experience with it.

So far in May nothing notable has happened. Today we had a band concert after school and we played well, I think. The thing I remember clearly from today was my shirt being tucked in and my belt buckle constantly hitting the wooden standup bass, echoing the sound throughout the auditorium.

I’m writing this offline right now so I’ll upload it as soon as I get connection. It’s 7:42pm, for the record.

Thanks for reading this after the huge silence here. I really should start writing more because I love writing, I just don’t have the content to write about. That’s the excuse, though, isn’t it
