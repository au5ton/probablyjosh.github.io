      <p><strong>It's been less than 2 weeks since I last wrote a blog post,</strong> so I guess that's good. I'm going to be writing about Friday (which was our school's Swing Night (essentially a dance)) because <a href="https://twitter.com/Sophia_Anne99/status/470673956676988928">Sophia wants me to</a>. I'll also be talking about <a href="http://codeday.org/">CodeDay</a> in Seattle, which I had the privilege of going to over the weekend. Also, since I seem to mention the song I'm listening to in every blog post, I might as well do it with this one as well- I'm listening to "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwOgXWOX-iE">Leaves That Are Gone</a>" by Simon and Garfunkel. It's a good song.</p>

<p><strong>Friday night was Swing Night.</strong> Our school's band puts on Swing Night once a year, every year, in May. It's always exciting and fun to be a part of. Students in band class showed up at around 5 PM because Mr. Turi (our band teacher (which I think I mentioned in earlier blog posts)) bought &amp; brought (I think Dominos) pizza for us. The pizza was pretty good. Then we helped set up for about half and hour.</p>

<p><strong>People started showing up to Swing Night at around 5:30,</strong> and doors opened at 6:00. I forget the order of what happened, so I'll write the gist of it. Grade 8s started playing their music at 6:30. Our band class played at 7. A couple that Mr. Turi hired to teach swing dance showed up and taught everyone how to swing dance. I danced mostly with <a href="https://twitter.com/ashleyiscoo">Ashley</a>, but also with a couple other people.</p>

<p><strong>At some point during the night,</strong> the junior and senior jazz bands went up to play. We (junior jazz) played 8 songs, which is relatively a lot. I played half and Maddie, the other bass player, played half. All I can remember from playing bass at Swing Night is that the amp was very loud and I made a couple mistakes and they were obvious and I was freaking out on stage because every time I made a mistake I freaked out and made another mistake and it was basically a cycle. I was kind of thankful when the songs ended and I got to sit down in a chair off stage and drink an Orange Crush that Adam had bought me.</p>

<p><strong>I danced with Ashley for a while longer,</strong> and everyone kept making orgasmic and humping faces at me while I was doing so. Good times.</p>

<p><strong>Swing Night ended at around 10:30,</strong> but anyone involved had to help out help clean up, which we did until about 11. I went home and watched an episode of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2372162/">Orange Is the New Black</a> and then slept.</p>

<p><strong>Actually, I'm pretty tired now, so I'll talk about CodeDay in the next blog post.</strong></p>
