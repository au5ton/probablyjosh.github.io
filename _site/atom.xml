   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Good lord, it’s been a while. I’m sorry to the probable 5-or-so people who read this blog, if this is even a valid reason to apologize.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyways, let’s try to brief up on the things that’ve happened recently since I haven’t updated anything for, like, 3 months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In March we...</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I better get to writing this soon because my whole “write a post once a month” thing is about to come to a screeching stop, seeing as I have about 45 minutes left to post this (as of writing this).

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, it’s been a while. I keep putting off writing this because of the classic “I have nothing to write about”, and the same thing still remains true. I’ll write this as another “check-up” because I don’t have much to discuss, but I have something to throw into the pot...</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hey, it’s my monthly check-in, I guess is what this is becoming..? Things are going well, so that’s good.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just realized that it’s been over a year since I started blogging (my first blog post was &lt;a href=&quot;http://nulljosh.svbtle.com/october-9-2013&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), and I guess I’m going to reflect upon things that happened in the past year, because I think that’s what people do when they realize it’s been a year since...</content>
