		<p>Good lord, it’s been a while. I’m sorry to the probable 5-or-so people who read this blog, if this is even a valid reason to apologize.</p>

<p>Anyways, let’s try to brief up on the things that’ve happened recently since I haven’t updated anything for, like, 3 months.</p>

<p>In March we had Spring Break and Better Call Saul. On the last day of Spring Break (I think) Jadon and I watched 6 hours of Better Call Saul to catch up on the episodes we’d missed. That’s the thing that stands out the most in March, for whatever reason.</p>

<p>Easter was in April but other things happened, too. Apple announced their WWDC Student Scholarship rules and everyone got cracking on their résumé-like apps. Last Friday at around noon the winners received emails letting them know they won the golden ticket. I was one of the unlucky ones, but I’ll try again next year with more knowledge and experience with it.</p>

<p>So far in May nothing notable has happened. Today we had a band concert after school and we played well, I think. The thing I remember clearly from today was my shirt being tucked in and my belt buckle constantly hitting the wooden standup bass, echoing the sound throughout the auditorium.</p>

<p>I’m writing this offline right now so I’ll upload it as soon as I get connection. It’s 7:42pm, for the record.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading this after the huge silence here. I really should start writing more because I love writing, I just don’t have the content to write about. That’s the excuse, though, isn’t it</p>
