      <p><strong>Hey guys, It's been a while.</strong> Like, almost a month. Um, I've been busy, so let me go over the things that've happened in the past month in code.</p>

<pre><code>relationship = ["Josh", "Mercedez"]; break;
newProject = "nuvel";
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Heh, code jokes.</strong> Anyways, Mercedez and I broke up and I started working on a new project with Lakota, as well as <a href="http://twitter.com/thetoxicarcade">Cameron</a>, a new friend. But really, almost nothing has happened.</p>

<p><strong>I also started getting more into working,</strong> which isn't a correct English sentence. I've started caring more about grades because I don't want to become a heroin addict and end up on the streets after getting C's because that happens to a ton of people obviously. Even in the month that I've been gone I haven't been involved with much that significantly interests me.</p>

<p><strong>I was invited to senior jazz band at school,</strong> which is an honour. I accepted but, like I expected, I'm pretty far behind the level they're at, so more practicing for me. I now have to wake up two times a week at 5:30 to get to jazz on time, but I'm not complaining because I'll get extra credits.</p>

<p>I've been playing a ton (fifty hours) of <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/252490">Rust</a>, and that's just over the past three weeks or so. No idea how I juggle jazz band, school / homework, projects with Lakota, and hours upon hours of Rust. Wait, that sounded egotistical. <em>I don't juggle it, I do my best.</em></p>

<p><strong>And sometimes I don't have enough time to even do that.</strong> <em>But that's just an excuse for excellent work or whatever.</em></p>
