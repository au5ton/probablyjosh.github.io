    <div class="post-body">
      <p><strong>Hey.</strong> The only reason I'm doing a blog post today is because <a href="https://twitter.com/Sophia_Anne99">Sophia</a> said she likes my blog posts. If it weren't for her, I'd probably be sleeping (or probably on <a href="http://imgur.com/">Imgur</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Alright</strong>, so <a href="http://blog.imjosh.me/april-30-2014">last blog post</a> basically reviewed the holiday <em>way</em> back in March, so that's pretty crazy. I'm getting caught up in the past, because, after all, the past is a cool place. Well, that's depending how far you go back. Like, I wouldn't want to be alive for the Black Plague or The Holocaust or anything.</p>

<p><strong>I just realized</strong> my blog is now going to be indexed by the word "holocaust". <em>Fantastic.</em></p>

<p><strong>Anyways,</strong> I'm listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_e49phsuRQ">Further On Down the Road</a> (the live version of the song is all I could find. Sorry), and coding a web crawler for <a href="https://github.com/LastHack/lasthack-crawler">LastHack</a>, a project I haven't gone over in a blog post yet. I'm not sure if anyone who reads this post will find any interest in LastHack, so I'll keep the description simple. <em>It's a script that runs in the background, finding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open-sourced</a> projects, which you can use to improve your own code in various ways.</em> If any of you have any use for that, go check it out. It's a cool idea (<a href="https://twitter.com/thetoxicarcade">Cameron</a> thought of it- I'm just helping him out).</p>

<p><strong>Today was a pretty good day.</strong> I woke up and ate Nutella toast because that's literally the best food in the world. I don't care if it's a "white girl stereotype". Obviously white girls have a good taste in food. I went to school because that's what kids do.</p>

<p><strong>My first class was Video Production</strong> and it was fairly exciting. It could've been better, it could've been worse. We were assigned our last project of the year. It's a pretty flexible project because we get to choose our own groups and the genre of the film, which is nice. I chose to work with Sami and Justin, and Alexis was put in our group because she didn't end up choosing anyone. In the end, it's a good group and I can work with them to make a (hopefully) good movie.</p>

<p><strong>I had Band next,</strong> which was also pretty fun. We played music.</p>

<p><strong>I had double block of English,</strong> which is normally not a great thing, but in the end we had absolutely no work assigned. We watched an hour long movie about advertisement.</p>

<p><strong>At Lunch,</strong> I went with Sami to the courtyard and showed him and his group of friends a comedy Sami and I had been part of / made for Video Production.</p>

<p><strong>For the second block of English,</strong> we discussed our thoughts and opinions on the advertisement movie for an hour. <em>Damn, son. Exciting.</em></p>

<p><strong>Last block was Gym,</strong> and we played Hockey. Half the class took everything too intensely and tried to injure everyone for the puck, and the other half took it as it is; Grade 9 gym class hockey.</p>

<p><strong>Today was Tutorial Wednesday,</strong> so school dismissal was an hour early. I showed some more people the video (the one I mentioned at Lunch) in the Video room. Then I walked with Sophia, Adam, Jamie and Ford to Camy's, where Sophia met Parim, the awesome Pizza Guy. I said bye to Sophia and Ford, and sprinted up to where Adam and Jamie were headed; Ed's Market. When I caught up to Jamie and Adam, Jamie told us some jokes regarding <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCvMB51i7JM">Mr. Turi playing in his band</a>. Adam bought me a Screamer (a slushee with soft serve ice cream- it's absolutely delicious), and then we walked home.</p>

<p><strong>When I got home,</strong> I spent about half an hour watching YouTube videos, and another hour learning Ruby on <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a>.</p>

<p>Now I'm listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_e49phsuRQ">Further On Down the Road</a> (the live version of the song is all I could find. Sorry), and coding a web crawler for <a href="https://github.com/LastHack/lasthack-crawler">LastHack</a>, a project I haven't gone over in a blog post yet.</p>

<p>whoa that was cool<br>
i looped the entire story<br>
that's crazy right<br><br>
aha ok cool<br>
thanks for reading my blog post for today<br>
bye guys</p>
