      <p><strong>Hi again</strong>.</p>

<p>First off, I've been making a couple changes with domains, and want to get that cleared off. I know this probably isn't 'blog' material, but whatever. <a href="http://imjosh.me">imjosh.me</a> is my main website. I don't really have much there, other than a couple links to different social networks. I'm planning to do something with it <em>eventually</em>. My other domain is <a href="http://joshuatrommel.com">joshuatrommel.com</a> which, as you can see if you click the link, is being used for my svbtle blog. I've moved from WordPress because I was finally invited <em>(after months of waiting)</em> to <a href="http://svbtle.com">svbtle.com</a>, so I moved everything from WordPress over here, and I'm glad everything went smoothly because I don't want to go back to WordPress any time soon.
<em>Good, now that's off my chest and hopefully everyone knows where to go.</em></p>

<p><strong>Today was a great day. Productive in a certain aspect, non-productive whatsoever in another.</strong> Today, I sat at home for almost 12 hours screwing around with my Wii. I also Skyped with Lakota and his friend for a couple hours, and talked to Mercedez all day. I didn't even make myself food, I just had cereal twice, and leftover chicken from Montana's last night. While I was doing this, everyone else went to America, land of the free <em>(haha not really)</em>. Pretty antisocial, I guess, but in retrospect it makes sense (kinda), because everyone is so loud. I don't care for loud people, unless there's a certain reason they have to be loud. Anyways, I'm getting a little off topic, which I tend to do quite often. <strong>Ahem.</strong></p>

<p>After 10 years of craving <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_The_Wind_Waker">Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker</a> I finally got it working.. kinda. I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmod#Softmods_for_Nintendo_Wii">softmodded</a> my Wii, and then installed a couple files that allow it to run files from a USB. I then found the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_image">.ISO</a> file for it on some random website, burned it to the USB, and finally got everything working perfectly. The entire <em>'project'</em> took about 4 hours. I then played Wind Waker for <strong>at least 10 hours</strong> <em>(I lost track of time).</em> Total time waster, but I'm glad I did it, because it was <strong>awesome</strong>. My next <em>'project'</em> is to get the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Ocarina_of_Time">Ocarina of Time</a> game working, because it's apparently awesome, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/HiddenPaws/status/399758811658850304">this tweet</a>.</p>

<p><em>Other than that, I didn't really do anything today. But I think everyone needs days like that once in a while.</em></p>

<p><strong><em>A quiet peaceful day to play Zelda.</em></strong></p>
