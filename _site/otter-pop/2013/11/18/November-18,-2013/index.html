    <div class="post-body">
      <p><strong>Today was amazing.</strong> Almost everything that could go right today went right and almost everything that could have gone wrong today didn't. Let me tell you how it went.</p>

<p><strong>I woke up at 7:30.</strong> My mom came downstairs and started talking to me without realizing the time (school starts at 8:15). I listened, but was curious if she would keep talking so I could be late (my first class was English which I'm not enjoying lately. If you're confused read my earlier posts). Sure enough she kept talking, and didn't stop until 8. I went upstairs to eat some Eggo's, which are my favourite food because they require almost no preparation or work. After eating I went and took a shower, then headed downstairs and got changed, dragged a comb across my head, threw my stuff in my backpack, pocketed some change for lunch and put my shoes on. By that time it was 9:10. I got in the car and headed off to school.</p>

<p><strong>By the time I got to school it was 9:30,</strong> and I was late by 5 minutes to gym. If it were any other class I would have run and grabbed my books, but since it was gym I decided to go to the cafeteria and browse Reddit. My reasoning for this is simple: Every time I'm late to Gym my teacher marks me as completely absent. I decided I didn't feel like running around in shorts for an hour to get the same grade as if I hadn't, so I took my decision.</p>

<p><strong>The bell rang after the block was over,</strong> and I started walking towards Video Production, which I was excited about because of the double block (today's block order for me was English-Gym-Video-Band). When I got there I sat down on my laptop and started touching up on the horror film we've been working on lately. I didn't really do anything especially exciting, but it was a fun, easy block. When the bell rang I went to Camy's Pizza for Lunch, and headed back to Video. When the second block started I did them same as the first. Easy 2 hours.</p>

<p><strong>My last block was Band,</strong> which is another easy hour. I play stand-up bass, so I just stood up and plucked strings for 60 or so minutes.</p>

<p><strong>After band I went to the library and participated in 'Homework Club', a <em>'club'</em> where you go if you're not doing well with your academics.</strong> In particular, I'm not doing great in Socials, so that's why I went. I did a bit of work there, and when it was over I went and found Mercedez, her friend Autumn, and my friend Cameron.</p>

<p><strong>We all went back to the Video Production room and we showed each other the films we've been working on.</strong> <em>I gave Mercedez the free hug that I promised her</em> <strong><em>(and she promised me)</em></strong>, and then we headed home. Autumn got her parents to pick her up, but Mercedez, Cameron and I had to walk home. <strong>In the pouring rain.</strong> Cameron had an umbrella, but I didn't fit so I went to the school's lost and found. There, I found a huge plastic bag which I wrapped myself in.</p>

<p><strong>Half way home Cameron had to leave</strong> to go to his house, so <em>Mercedez and I were alone to talk.</em> Again, we didn't talk about anything particularly interesting, but just talking to her kept me happy. When we got to her house I gave her a hug and said goodnight, then headed back to my house, which is only a 30 second walk away.</p>

<p><strong>When I got home I put on some pajamas</strong> and started changing up <a href="http://imjosh.me">imjosh.me</a> for fun. I had Dinner, and now I'm here.</p>

<p><strong>Awesome day.</strong></p>
