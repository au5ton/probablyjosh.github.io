      <p>Today was better than yesterday. First off, I had the rest of my 8 blocks. The way my school works is different, but it’s a good method. I have 8 classes that I have to be to in total. On day 1, I have the first 4 rotations, and on day 2, I have the 5 – 8 rotations. These rotations change order but all classes retain days, therefor Block 7 would never be with Block 2.</p>

<p>I definitely favour Day 2 over Day 1. First off, I have my favourite class of all time, Video Production, in Block 6, after Band (which I probably won’t be talking about in this post, simply because it wasn’t very exciting), which is also happens to be one of my favourite classes, due to the great teacher. Video Production is, simply put, what school should be like. It’s a place for everyone to express themselves in the way they see fit, and as long at what they present retains their maturity level (no sexual references, no degradation of sexes, etc), they can film what they like, and then display it on the big screen for the class to watch. This, of course, gives everybody many different options on who they’d like to to work with on their film. Currently, a couple of friends and I are filming Loveless, which is an awesome song by ‘Said the Whale’. It’s gone pretty good so far, and what’s turned out in the end isn’t exactly how I pictured it in the beginning, but that’s life.</p>

<p>After Video Production I have Gym, which I’ll admit is near the bottom of the “My Favourite Classes” list. Typically, I’ll shove my gym strip on and go with whatever [the gym teacher]‘s instructions are (usually a straight hour of push-ups and sit-ups), but today my friend, Alex, forgot his strip, and I didn’t really want to go to Gym anyways, as I was aware they where going to run laps at the dog park around the corner, which is about the worst thing to do in Gym. I decided to tell [the gym teacher] I had forgotten my stuff. Since he doesn’t get paid enough to care, he told me to go to the cafeteria and finish whatever homework I had due soon. Another one of my friends, Tyler, told [the gym teacher] that he had just sprained his ankle prior to arriving to class. Apparently his story was boughten, and we all headed to the cafeteria and waited for [the gym teacher] to bring the class to the dog park (off school grounds). Once they had rounded the corner, Alex, Tyler and I headed up to the library. I started programming tidbits of projects I’ve been working on, while Tyler and Alex played Happy Wheels, which seems to be accustomed to our school. This is what we did for the rest of class (1 hour). About 10 minutes before the bell rung, [the gym teacher] walked into the library, completed disregarding me and Alex’s existence, and headed straight for Tyler. Apparently Tyler hadn’t mentioned that he was away, so [the gym teacher] had marked Tyler as 100% there. My guess is that [the gym teacher] realized Tyler wasn’t there half way through class, and had to wait until the end of class to address it. He started yelling at Tyler in the middle of the library, and I’d be lying if I told you I didn’t laugh. After the feud between Tyler and [the gym teacher] was finished, the bell rang. We headed down to the film studio to finish up some editing on the film I was telling you about earlier, but soon saw that the room was being taken up by the ‘Gay-Straight Alliance Club’, meaning we weren’t allowed in for any video related stuff. We ate our lunches outside the room, and then headed back to the gym when the bell rang for the end of lunch. Tyler went and got his gym strip, in hopes that [the gym teacher] wouldn’t call his parents about what he had done, while Alex and I went to tell [the gym teacher] that we “still hadn’t found our strip”, then headed down to finish the video in film, and edited for the rest of class.</p>

<p>My last class of the day was English, which was pretty good, but nothing special. My teacher, Mr. Rice (great name), told us to go finish the rest of the project we had been working on. I finished mine in 10 minutes, and I talked to a couple of my friends, debating about iOS over Android for the rest of class.</p>

<p><strong>Definitely a better day than yesterday.</strong></p>

<p>PS. With any teacher I don’t specifically enjoy, I’ll use their names as such: [subject teacher], thus not revealing any identities. Any teachers that I enjoy, I will include the name</p>
