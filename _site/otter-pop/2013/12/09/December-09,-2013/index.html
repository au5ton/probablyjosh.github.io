      <p><strong>There's 4 days until report cards.</strong> Damn. Damn damn. Not good, not good.</p>

<p><strong>Everything has gone alright with everything in life,</strong> I guess. Nothing extremely disastrous has happened to me so I take that as an achievement.</p>

<p><strong>On another note,</strong> I've changed almost everything I own to <a href="http://www.colorhexa.com/900020">burgundy</a>, red, or something close. All the links on <a href="http://imjosh.me">my website</a> are red now, and I went out and bought a burgundy beanie (toque?) and a burgundy (along with other colours) sweater. It's a sudden change from <a href="http://www.colorhexa.com/3498db">this particular shade of blue</a>, but I think I like it. Apologies about going on a small rant about burgundy and my change to it.</p>

<p><strong>Like most people, I'm looking forward to the holidays.</strong> It's a nice break from school and time to spend time with family and friends while not having to put on pants, which is the ultimate win because pants are terrible <em>(pyjamas4lyfe)</em>.</p>

<p><strong>I really haven't had anything too interesting happen to me lately,</strong> despite the suspension happen so recently. Even though that seemed to cause a bump in the road everything is back to normal, <em>mostly</em>. I've made a few changes, mostly to making a <a href="http://twitter.com/joshtrommel">private twitter</a> for personal friends so that I don't have to be so careful and superstitious about what I say. This doesn't mean that I'm going to go start writing garbage on it, it's just a place I can write without being suspended over my (possibly awful) opinions. Hopefully I'm not suspended for writing that as well. As nice as I try to be I want to get one point across that's been on my mind for a while - If you don't like something on the internet, leave it alone unless it's viciously negatively directly affecting you. That's all I have to say, I hope forever.</p>

<p><strong>Although not a lot has happened to me recently,</strong> I was able to start a <a href="http://medium.com/@nulljosh">Medium account</a>, where I've only posted <a href="https://medium.com/p/e016c3cd42ff">this story</a> about the internet.</p>

<p><strong>Reading over this post,</strong> it looks like I jumped around to different topics a ton. I need to make a "do's and don'ts" for writing sometime. I guess that's all I can think of writing about. <strong><em>Ciao.</em></strong></p>
