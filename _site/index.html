	  	<p>Good lord, it’s been a while. I’m sorry to the probable 5-or-so people who read this blog, if this is even a valid reason to apologize. Anyways, let’s try to brief up on the things that’ve happened recently since I haven’t updated anything for, like, 3 months. In March we...</p>

	  	<p>I better get to writing this soon because my whole “write a post once a month” thing is about to come to a screeching stop, seeing as I have about 45 minutes left to post this (as of writing this). Alright, let’s see what happened in the past month. I’ll...</p>

	  	<p>Well, it’s been a while. I keep putting off writing this because of the classic “I have nothing to write about”, and the same thing still remains true. I’ll write this as another “check-up” because I don’t have much to discuss, but I have something to throw into the pot...</p>

	  	<p>Hey, it’s my monthly check-in, I guess is what this is becoming..? Things are going well, so that’s good. Life is more spontaneous than last time I wrote a post, and I think that was my major goal since, like, probably forever (but mostly recently) so that’s currently being achieved,...</p>

	  	<p>I just realized that it’s been over a year since I started blogging (my first blog post was here), and I guess I’m going to reflect upon things that happened in the past year, because I think that’s what people do when they realize it’s been a year since a...</p>
