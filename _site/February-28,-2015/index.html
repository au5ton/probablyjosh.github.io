		<p>I better get to writing this soon because my whole “write a post once a month” thing is about to come to a screeching stop, seeing as I have about 45 minutes left to post this (as of writing this). Alright, let’s see what happened in the past month. I’ll go look through my calendar.</p>

<p>Groundhog Day and Family Day were this month. I don’t know why I’m mentioning that but those are the two first events on my calendar.</p>

<p>Phil’s birthday was on the 20th (held on the 19th because Sami couldn’t make it on the 20th), so I went to that. We just talked, mostly. There was a pool table in the place Phil rented out so we played pool together.</p>

<p>CodeDay was on Valentine’s Day this month. I went to the event in Seattle, as usual. I was single this Valentine’s Day (*cringing* This sounds like such a teen thing to say) because Jayda and I broke up on the Wednesday prior to it. Not going to discuss it because I don’t like discussing things in that personal category, at least not online. CodeDay, however, was fun, once again. Although what we made didn’t work out in the end (<a href="https://github.com/TheUnderscores/notzombs">notzombs</a>, a top-down, procedurally generated zombie survival game), it was still an awesome event to go to, once again. I also wrote <a href="https://github.com/trommel/cards">Cards</a> there, but I didn’t get it working until after CodeDay had ended. Regardless, fun time and I met some awesome people there.</p>

<p>Right now I’m listening to <a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/42G5ULkCRRl3crJMlg6eKd">Into The Great Wide Open</a> on Spotify. Great album. I also really want to make a music video about <a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/0NnZehYkI36qrtENwR86qS">Dukes Up</a>, recorded somewhere urban, like Vancouver, but early in the morning, before the people come out. Maybe I could go down there with <em>the gang</em> some time and get some footage and throw together a <em>good ‘ol music video</em> or something.</p>

<p>Or maybe I could film something even better, like something with a story and plot and a beginning, middle, and end. Who knows.</p>
