About
=====
I write a blog here. I also have social networks that I'm kind of a part of but I'm trying to stay away from stuff like Twitter for now. I'm a fan of media tracking social networks, for some reason. Hopefully you understand.

I'm a 16 year-old developer (hardly) and designer (barely). Hard on myself, yes. I'm also extremely modest. I don't know what else to write for this paragraph.

I've been **interested in programming for a big portion of my life,** probably the better part. I became interested in it in grade 6 when I found AppleScript and the ability to make infinite annoying popups from a line or three of code, save it as an application bundle, disguise it as Safari, throw it on the dock, and watch how things played out for my lab teacher when asking for internet help. My life changed forever after that. Although I don't mischeviously code much anymore I do have a [GitHub](https://github.com/probablyjosh) profile where I upload my projects. You can check it out if you'd like to see what I've written. 

Design has always been a side thing for me, and I certianly don't express it enough. I really shouldn't call myself a designer, but I like the name. I can only describe it as more of a hobby than something I have extensive knowledge with. Typography is my favourite
category of design, but I couldn't name a typography term if my life depended on it.

I also really like video production and photography but that doesn't necessarily make me good at either one. I've taken a video production course called [Backstreet Studios](http://ydme.ca/backstreet/) held at my high school for 5 years (and this year volenteering), and enjoyed it extensively. Photography is more of a knack I've picked up myself. I use [Instagram](https://github.com/adjectivepug) for my photo uploads, just because it's too late at this point to switch to Flickr. I use VSCOCam for the majority of my photos, hopefully you're not judgemental.

Magic The Gathering is also fun. I'm new to it and I'm awful. I've spent way too much money on it already.

I think that concludes my hobbies. I'll add more as I develop as a person.

I'll write about my every day life here, if I have time, which I usually do not.
